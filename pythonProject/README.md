# 1. Theory
- To caculate Spo2 from PPG signal, we need two types of data is IR PPG and RED PPG

    ![Formular calculate SpO2](Processing_PPG_Signal/pythonProject/pictures/How_to_caculate_Spo2.png)

- SpO2 = 110 - 25*R with R defined above picture

# 2. Result
- This is the result I collected data by sensr MAX30102 and processing signal by python.
